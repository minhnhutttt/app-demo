          <p class="paragraph"><strong>Cardano explained</strong></p>
          <p class="paragraph">Cardano is a decentralized third-generation proof-of-stake blockchain platform and home
            to the ada cryptocurrency. It is the first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and
            a research-first driven approach.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">The Cardano platform has been designed from the ground up and verified by an
            industry-leading combination of top engineers and academic experts in the fields of blockchain and
            cryptography. It has a strong focus on sustainability, scalability, and transparency. It is a fully open
            source project that aims to deliver an inclusive, fair, and resilient infrastructure for financial and
            social applications on a global scale. One of its primary goals is to bring reliable, secure financial
            services to those people who do not currently have access. </p>
          <p class="paragraph">Cardano has been designed with security as one of its founding principles. It is written
            in Haskell, a functional programming language. In a functional language like Haskell, building your system
            using pure functions is encouraged, which leads to a design where components are conveniently testable in
            isolation. Furthermore, advanced features of Haskell enable us to employ a whole range of powerful methods
            for ensuring correctness of the code, such as basing the implementation on formal and executable
            specifications, extensive property-based testing, and running tests in simulation.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Cardano is developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced
            features than any protocol previously developed and will serve as a stable and secure platform for the
            development of enterprise-level dApps. In the near future, Cardano will use a democratic governance system
            that allows the project to evolve over time, and fund itself in a sustainable way through a visionary
            treasury system. </p>
